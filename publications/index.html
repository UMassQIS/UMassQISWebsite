Chip-scale integration of ultra-low noise lasers and reference cavities operating directly at optical clock transitions and capable of qubit and clock operations will represent a major transformation in atom and trapped ion-based quantum technologies. However, this goal has remained elusive. Here we report the first demonstration of chip-scale optical clock and qubit operations on a trapped ion using a photonic integrated direct-drive visible wavelength Brillouin laser stabilized to an integrated 3-meter coil-resonator reference cavity and the optical clock transition of a $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ion trapped on a surface electrode chip.

In this work, we examine entropic measures of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) and information (MII) for the ground-states of quantum many-body systems in one- and two- spatial dimensions. From numerical and analytic analysis of a variety of models encompassing critical points, quantum Hall states, string-net topological orders, and Fermi liquids, we identify universal features of the long-distance structure of MIE and MII that depend only on the underlying phase or critical universality class of the state. We argue that, whereas in $1d$ the leading contributions to long-range MIE and MII are universal, in $2d$, the existence of a teleportation transition for finite-depth circuits implies that trivial $2d$ states can exhibit long-range MIE, and the universal features lie in sub-leading corrections. We introduce modified MIE measures that directly extract these universal contributions. As a corollary, we show that the leading contributions to strange-correlators, used to numerically identify topological phases, are in fact non-universal in two or more dimensions, and explain how our modified constructions enable one to isolate universal components.

One of the most promising codes on the superconducting qubit platform is the surface code, requiring a realistically attainable error threshold and the ability to perform universal fault-tolerant quantum computing with local operations via lattice surgery and magic state injection. Surface code architectures easily generalize to single-chip planar layouts, however space and control hardware constraints point to limits on the number of qubits that can fit on one chip. Additionally, the planar routing on single-chip architectures leads to serialization of commuting gates and strain on classical decoding caused by large ancilla patches. A distributed multi-chip architecture utilizing the surface code can potentially solve these problems if one can optimize inter-chip gates, manage collisions in networking between chips, and minimize routing hardware costs. We propose QuIRC, a superconducting Quantum Interface Routing Card for Lattice Surgery between surface code modules inside of a single dilution refrigerator. QuIRC improves scaling by allowing connection of many modules, increases ancilla connectivity of surface code lattices, and offers improved transpilation of Pauli-based surface code circuits. QuIRC employs in-situ Entangled Pair (EP) generation protocols for communication. We explore potential topological layouts of QuIRC based on superconducting hardware fabrication constraints, and demonstrate reductions in ancilla patch size by up to 77.8%, and in layer transpilation size by 51.9% when compared to the single-chip case.</p> </details> </div> </div> <div class=publication > <div class=well > <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03438v1">Generalized hydrodynamics: a perspective</a></h3> <p><em>Benjamin Doyon, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Frederik Møller, Jörg Schmiedmayer, Romain Vasseur</em></p> <p><strong><!--preprint--> 2023-11-06</strong></p> <details> <summary>Conventional hydrodynamics describes systems with few long-lived excitations.

Limiting our focus to the case where only bipartite entangled states are generated across the network, we cast the problem as an instance of generalized flow maximization between two quantum end nodes wishing to communicate. We propose a mixed-integer quadratically constrained program (MIQCP) to solve this flow problem for networks with arbitrary topology. We then compute the overall network capacity, defined as the maximum number of EPR states distributed to users per time unit, by solving the flow problem for all possible network states generated by probabilistic entangled link presence and absence, and subsequently by averaging over all network state capacities. The MIQCP can also be applied to networks with multiplexed links.

Rather surprisingly, experimental results with around twenty photons are in line with the semi-classical predictions. Theoretical analysis has been fragmented due to the difficulty of treating nonlinear many-body quantum systems. Here we are able to solve this problem by constructing a powerful theory of the generation of optical nonlinearities by single emitters and ensembles. The key to this construction is the application of perturbation theory to perturbations generated by subsystems. This theory reveals critical properties of ensembles that have long been obscure. The most remarkable of these is the discovery that quantum effects prevent ensembles generating single-photon nonlinearities only within the rotating-wave regime; outside this regime single-photon nonlinearities scale as the number of emitters. The theory we present here also provides an efficient way to calculate nonlinearities for arbitrary multi-level driving schemes, and we expect that it will prove a powerful foundation for further advances in this area.</p> </details> </div> </div> <div class=publication > <div class=well > <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11457v1">Emergence of fluctuating hydrodynamics in chaotic quantum systems</a></h3> <p><em>Julian F.

The crucial feature of the GKP code that we make use of is the fact that GKP qubits easily admit deterministic two-qubit gates, hence allowing for multiplexing without the need for generating large cluster states as required in previous all-photonic architectures based on discrete-variable codes. Moreover, alleviating the need for such clique-clusters entails that we are no longer limited to extraction of at most one end-to-end entangled pair from a single protocol run. In fact, thanks to the availability of the analog information generated during the measurements of the GKP qubits, we can design better entanglement swapping procedures in which we connect links based on their estimated quality. This enables us to use all the multiplexed links so that large number of links from a single protocol run can contribute to the generation of the end-to-end entanglement. We find that our architecture allows for high-rate end-to-end entanglement generation and is resilient to imperfections arising from finite squeezing in the GKP state preparation and homodyne detection inefficiency. In particular we show that long-distance quantum communication over more than 1000 km is possible even with less than 13 dB of GKP squeezing.

Under such a concatenation scheme, the analog information from the inner GKP error correction improves the noise threshold of the outer code. However, the surface code has vanishing rate and demands a lot of resources with growing distance. In this work, we concatenate the GKP code with generic quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes and demonstrate a natural way to exploit the GKP analog information in iterative decoding algorithms. We first show the noise thresholds for two lifted product QLDPC code families, and then show the improvements of noise thresholds when the iterative decoder - a hardware-friendly min-sum algorithm (MSA) - utilizes the GKP analog information. We also show that, when the GKP analog information is combined with a sequential update schedule for MSA, the scheme surpasses the well-known CSS Hamming bound for these code families. Furthermore, we observe that the GKP analog information helps the iterative decoder in escaping harmful trapping sets in the Tanner graph of the QLDPC code, thereby eliminating or significantly lowering the error floor of the logical error rate curves.

This region where the distance independent rate occurs is the supercritical region of a new percolation problem. We extend this GHZ protocol to incorporate a time-multiplexing blocklength $k$, the number of time slots over which a repeater can mix-and-match successful links to perform fusion on. As $k$ increases, the supercritical region expands. For a given $(p,q)$, the entanglement rate initially increases with $k$, and once inside the supercritical region for a high enough $k$, it decays as $1/k$ GHZ states per time slot. When memory coherence time exponentially distributed with mean $\mu$ is incorporated, it is seen that increasing $k$ does not indefinitely increase the supercritical region; it has a hard $\mu$ dependent limit. Finally, we find that incorporating space-division multiplexing, i.e., running the above protocol independently in up to $d$ disconnected network regions, where $d$ is the network's node degree, one can go beyond the 1 GHZ state per time slot rate that the above randomized local link-state protocol cannot surpass.

Previous results on random circuits have only shown that $O(N^{1/D})$ depth suffices or that $O(\log^3 N)$ depth suffices for all-to-all connectivity ($D \to \infty$). We then study the critical behavior of the erasure threshold in the so-called moderate deviation limit, where both the failure probability and the distance to the optimal threshold converge to zero with $N$. We find that the requisite depth scales like $O(\log N)$ only for dimensions $D \ge 2$, and that random circuits require $O(\sqrt{N})$ depth for $D=1$. Finally, we introduce an "expurgation" algorithm that uses quantum measurements to remove logical operators that cause the code to fail by turning them into additional stabilizers or gauge operators. With such targeted measurements, we can achieve sub-logarithmic depth in $D\ge 2$ below capacity without increasing the maximum weight of the check operators. We find that for any rate beneath the capacity, high-performing codes with thousands of logical qubits are achievable with depth 4-8 expurgated random circuits in $D=2$ dimensions.

We propose three routing algorithms and analytically show that as expected when there is only a single request in the network, then employing them on the continuous model yields a lower latency than on the on-demand one. We study the performance of the routing algorithms in a ring, grid, and recursively generated network topologies.

Using Markov chains, we model a set of randomized switching policies. Discovering that some are better than others, we present analytical results for the case where the switch stores one qubit per user, and find that the best policies outperform a time division multiplexing (TDM) policy for sharing the switch between bipartite and tripartite state generation. This performance improvement decreases as the number of users grows. The model is easily augmented to study the capacity region in the presence of quantum state decoherence and associated cut-off times for qubit storage, obtaining similar results. Moreover, decoherence-associated quantum storage cut-off times appear to have little effect on capacity in our identical-link system. We also study a smaller class of policies when the switch stores two qubits per user.</p> </details> </div> </div> <div class=publication > <div class=well > <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02939v1">Quantum Brownian motion in a quasiperiodic potential</a></h3> <p><em>Aaron J Friedman, Romain Vasseur, Austen Lamacraft, S.

This is in contrast with the usual periodic spin chains which involve only local interactions, and are described by the periodic TL algebra. We show that for the Restricted Solid-On-Solid models, which are known to be described by minimal unitary CFTs in the continuum limit, the braid translation in fact does provide the ordinary periodic model starting from the open model with fixed boundary conditions on the two sides of the strip. This statement has a precise mathematical formulation, which is a pull-back map between irreducible modules of, respectively, the blob algebra and the affine TL algebra. We then turn to the same kind of analysis for two models whose continuum limits are Logarithmic CFTs - the alternating gl(1|1) and sl(2|1) spin chains. We find that the result for minimal models does not hold any longer: braid translation of the relevant TL modules does not give rise to the modules known to be present in the periodic chains. In the gl(1|1) case, the content in terms of the irreducibles is the same, as well as the spectrum, but the detailed structure (like logarithmic coupling) is profoundly different.

Here, we assess the performance of a specific but very natural setup called a single sequential repeater for quantum key distribution. We offer a fine-grained assessment of the repeater by introducing a series of benchmarks. The benchmarks, which should be surpassed to claim a working repeater, are based on finite-energy considerations, thermal noise and the losses in the setup. In order to boost the performance of the studied repeaters we introduce two methods. The first one corresponds to the concept of a cut-off, which reduces the effect of decoherence during storage of a quantum state by introducing a maximum storage time. Secondly, we supplement the standard classical post-processing with an advantage distillation procedure. Using these methods, we find realistic parameters for which it is possible to achieve rates greater than each of the benchmarks, guiding the way towards implementing quantum repeaters.</p> </details> </div> </div> <div class=publication > <div class=well > <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03466v3">Solvable Hydrodynamics of Quantum Integrable Systems</a></h3> <p><em>Vir B.

We show in this paper that the small coupling expansion of the entanglement entropy in this problem is quite generally plagued by strong infrared divergences, implying a non-perturbative dependence on the coupling. The large coupling expansion turns out to be better behaved, thanks to powerful results from the boundary CFT formulation and, in some cases, the underlying integrability of the problem.

The determination of these indecomposability parameters has given rise to a lot of algebraic work, but their physical meaning has remained somewhat elusive. In a recent paper, a way to measure b for boundary percolation and polymers was proposed. We generalize this work here by devising a general strategy to compute matrix elements of Virasoro generators from the numerical analysis of lattice models and their continuum limit. The method is applied to XXZ spin-1/2 and spin-1 chains with open (free) boundary conditions. They are related to gl(n+m|m) and osp(n+2m|2m)-invariant superspin chains and to nonlinear sigma models with supercoset target spaces.

We then consider transitions with two-component ($N_{OP} = 2$) pseudospins: the equilateral to centred-rectangle ($N_V =3$); the square to oblique polygon ($N_V =4$); the triangle to oblique ($N_V =6$) transitions; and finally the 3D cubic to tetragonal transition ($ N_V =3$). The local meanfield solutions in 2D and 3D yield oriented domain-walls patterns as from continuous-variable strain dynamics, showing the discrete-variable models capture the essential ferroelastic texturings. Other related hamiltonians illustrate that structural-transitions in materials science can be the source of interesting spin models in statistical mechanics.</p> </details> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="container footer lighter"> <p> University of Massachusetts Amherst | <a href="https://www.umass.edu//gateway/site-policies" data-drupal-link-system-path="node/3861">Site Policies</a> | <a href="https://www.umass.edu/policy/information-privacy-policy" title="UMass Amherst privacy policy">Privacy</a> | <a href="https://www.umass.edu/policy/affirmative-action-non-discrimination-and-title-ix-non-discrimination-policy" title="UMass Amherst non-discrimination policies">Non-Discrimination Notice</a> | <a href="https://www.umass.edu/accessibility/" title="UMass Amherst Accessibility Resources">Accessibility</a> | <a href="https://www.umass.edu/it/policies/it-policy-acceptable-use-interpretation-guidelines" title="UMass Amherst terms of use">Terms of Use</a> </p> </div> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <script src="/./libs/highlight.pack.js"></script> <script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script>
