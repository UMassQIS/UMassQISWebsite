<h3>2023 Spring: COMPSCI 692U: Quantum Error Correcting Codes</h3>
~~~

The ability to transmit quantum information over long distances will enable implementation of many fascinating quantum communication tasks and provide us with novel capabilities that reach beyond what we can do over classical Internet alone. Examples of such tasks include blind quantum computing, clock synchronization or distributed quantum computing.

Quantum cryptography is one family of such tasks with the most famous one being quantum key distribution. This task, which is currently the most mature quantum technology, enables distribution of shared keys through a protocol that is information-theoretically secure and whose security remarkably is guaranteed by the laws of quantum physics. Such unconditional security cannot be achieved in the classical world.

In the first part, the course will introduce the world of quantum cryptographic protocols and describe how the power of quantum mechanics can enable distribution of shared secret keys even with untrusted devices. It will also introduce many other fascinating quantum protocols beyond quantum key distribution.

In the second part we will learn about the uniquely quantum challenges of transmitting quantum information over long distances. We will then study how to overcome them using different types of the so-called “quantum repeaters”. We will finish by investigating the fundamental limits of quantum communication over practical noisy channels and we will use this framework for assessing quantum repeater performance.

Led by Stefan Krastanov and Don Towsley.

<h3>2024 Spring: COMPSCI 692Z: Seminar - Topics in Quantum Networks </h3>
~~~

This seminar will cover topics in quantum networks. This includes topics in quantum network architectures including one-way vs. two-way architectures and terrestrial vs. satellite networks; quantum repeater and switch design; techniques for overcoming noise in a network including entanglement distillation and quantum error correction; resource allocation including routing and path selection, and scheduling. Other topics include distributed quantum computing; performance modeling and analysis of quantum networks with an emphasis on capacity and on the quality of quantum states delivered to end users; quantum network measurement including quantum network tomography. All students taking the seminar for credit will be expected to present papers on these topics and to participate in classroom discussion. Students taking the seminar for 3 credits will be expected to propose and complete a project. The two objectives of this seminar are to bring everyone, including instructors, up to speed regarding the state of the art in quantum networks.

Led by Kenneth Goodenough, Filip Rozpedek, and Don Towsley.
